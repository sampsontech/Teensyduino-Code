SparkFun-9DOF-IMU
=================

Experimental code running on the Arduino / Teensy platform interfacing with the SparkFun 9DOF IMU

The idea is to develop a set of code/library to allow a MCU - such as arduino /Teensy etc - to interface with the SparkFun 9DOF IMU with minimal effort. The code will also provide some other features such as sensor Auto Calibration and ultimatly some sensor fusion.
